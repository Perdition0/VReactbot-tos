# Privacy Policy
Here we have provided details about the data BoboiBot collects and what its used for.

## What do we collect
- Server IDs: Used to store server options such as custom prefixes etc.
- Message Content: Never stored, but is used for making legacy commands work.
- BoboiBot also stores your userid if you were in our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/vnN3EFsHjR)
- If at any time you were blacklisted, temporary or permanent from our bot, **blacklist information will be stored**.
- When you get blacklisted **your userid, the admins userid, the date, and reason are stored**.
- If you get muted, kicked or banned from a guild, **your userid is stored**.
- If your guild sets a **modlog, mutedrole or prefix, the guild id, channel-id, prefix, and/or roleid gets stored**.
- If you leave and rejoin a guild, **your userid is stored in order to reapply the roles** *if such a module is enabled by server administrator*.
## Where Do We Store The Data?

**The Bot may keep the stored information in an internal cacheing mechanic for a certain amount of time.
After this time period, the cached information will be dropped and only be re-added when required.**

**Data may be dropped from cache pre-maturely through actions such as removing the bot from the Server.**

## How we use the data
The data is used to make the bot functional and customizable. Without this data custom prefixes, recent-commands, channel,moderation based commands  and more would not be supported. We will definitely not share or sell the stored data to any 3rd party companies or individuals.

## Removal of Data

**Stored Data can be removed automatically through means of removing the bot from a Server. This can be achieved by either kicking or banning the bot from the server. Re-inviting the bot will add the same default values, as mentioned above, back to the bot's database.**

## Concerns
If you have any concerns regarding the data we collect or you would like to delete your data please join the [support server](https://discord.gg/vnN3EFsHjR).
